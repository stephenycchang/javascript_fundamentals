// Exercises: Arrays

// EXERCISE: Your top choices

// Create an array to hold your top choices (colors, presidents, whatever).
// For each choice, log to the screen a string like: "My #1 choice is blue."
// Bonus: Change it to log "My 1st choice, "My 2nd choice", "My 3rd choice", picking the right suffix for the number based on what it is.

var colours = ["blue" , "green", "yellow"];
console.log("My #1 choice is " + colours[0])
console.log("My #2 choice is " + colours[1])
console.log("My #3 choice is " + colours[2])
